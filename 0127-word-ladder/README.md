# 127. Word Ladder

## Description

A **transformation sequence** from word  `beginWord`  to word  `endWord`  using a dictionary  `wordList`  is a sequence of words  `beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk`  such that:

	
- Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
	
- Every  `si`  for  `1  "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> cog", which is 5 words long.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
Output: 0
Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.
```

 

**Constraints:**

	
-  `1 <= beginWord.length <= 10` 
	
-  `endWord.length == beginWord.length` 
	
-  `1 <= wordList.length <= 5000` 
	
-  `wordList[i].length == beginWord.length` 
	
-  `beginWord` ,  `endWord` , and  `wordList[i]`  consist of lowercase English letters.
	
-  `beginWord != endWord` 
	
- All the words in  `wordList`  are **unique**.
